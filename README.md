To edit controls tap the “edit" icon in your project.

Next Tap on the “new control” icon to add another control or tap on any of the edit buttons attached to a control to edit that control. When you are done tap the "finish editing" icon.

The “Touch Down Action” is the command that is sent to the Bean or Bean + as soon as you tap the button, the “Touch Up Action” is sent when your finger lifts off of the button. For most use cases I would recommend only using the “Touch Down Action”.
